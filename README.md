### What is this repository for? ###

This repository holds code submitted for my MSc Intelligent Systems dissertation.

### Overview ###
The project takes the following paper as its baseline:

Levy, O., Søgaard, A., & Goldberg, Y. (2017). A Strong Baseline for Learning Cross-Lingual Word Embeddings from Sentence Alignments. In EACL.

### Code & Data Dependencies ###
Levy et al's code is available from:
